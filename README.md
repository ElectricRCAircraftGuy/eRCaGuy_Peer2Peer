# eRCaGuy_Peer2Peer Arduino library 

## DESCRIPTION:   
 - Ideal for getting two or more microcontrollers (ex: Arduinos) to talk to each other
 - A peer-to-peer send and receive synchronous half-duplex communication protocol with handshaking and auto-timeout, that requires only 2 pins (any 2 pins) per peer and no additional timers, and no interrupts whatsoever (but can optionally use them for increased performance).  
 - Use this library in place of SPI, standard Serial, or I2C (AKA IIC, Wire, or 2-Wire), when you don't want to be required to use hardware-specific pins.  
 - Use in place of SoftwareSerial when you want to be able to receive without having to use Pin Change Interrupts.
